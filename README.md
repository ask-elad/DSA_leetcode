# ðŸ“˜ LeetCode Progress Tracker

This repository serves as a personal archive of my **LeetCode submissions**, helping me stay on track during my DSA journey.

I'm aiming to cover all the major **data structures and algorithms** by the end of this year, and this repo is a way to document that progress automatically.

Every time I get an **Accepted** submission on LeetCode, it's instantly recorded and pushed here â€” powered by a custom browser extension I use:  
ðŸ”— [BeatCode Extension](https://github.com/ask-elad/BeatCode)

No manual effort â€” just pure consistency.

> ðŸ§  Goal: Finish all core DSA topics by end of the year.
